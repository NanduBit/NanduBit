And you can chnage your bot icon and name from there also

And sign in to a account

Now you will notice the seperate tab comming in the console section this is the website 

(Replit project cannot be only forever by common users so we have to make a website and ping it with the services to make it online forever)

**Step3**

And copy the URL that was comming in the seperate tab in the console the url should be like

`https://Discord.jsV13-Template.{your replit name}.repl.co` 

https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/915153824304496665/940464564338835466/Screenshot_2022-02-08-10-00-14-520.jpeg

Got to https://uptimerobot.com/signUp and sign in and click on add moniter make it https type

And put the copied URL on the url section and click add moniter

https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/915153824304496665/940463174774304768/20220208_095425.jpg?width=515&height=610

Now your bot is ready to be invited to your server 

To invite your bot to your server is simple you have to copy the application I'd from the general information in https://discord.com/developers/applications 

 And replace the **<clientID>** in this url and paste it to your browser and invite your bot

https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=**<clientID>**&permissions=8&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.com%2Foauth2%2Fauthorized&response_type=code&scope=email%20bot

Your bot is ready 

 go to the server you invited the bot to and type .ping it will reply as pong!

  This is the only command the bot has 

  You have to make other commands 

  **IF YOU NEED A BOT WITH ALL COMMAND YOU HAVE TO CONTACT @Nandu#7599 OR (admin.toka.cf by email) to get premium all command pakage**

If your bot didn't work just stop the replit project and start again

If you get a error on the console pls send the ss to admin.toka.cf 

TIPS

never share your bot token to anybody you don't trust they can hack your bot

As always itz me Nandu
